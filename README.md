# Gale Shapley Algorithm implementation in Java
This is my implementation of the Gale Shapley Algorithm written 
completely in Java. This was one of my semester projects in the
Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH). The algorithm has a couple
of Key features that in my opinion make it a solid implementation.

- It runs in worst case O(n^2) and best case O(n)
- Memory consumption is low as it only uses an arrays of int
- Javadoc is written for all major methods.
- There are a couple of JUnit tests, which test the validity of the implementation

### Javadoc
The main implementation is in the package "gale.light". The algorithm uses a differently
structured array as input data compared to other implementations. To understand it, it is advised
to read the javadoc.

### Written Report, Data and Presentation Slides
In the documents folder is a written report, explaining some basics of the
stable marriage problem and the gale shapley algorithm. There are also
slides I used for my presentation of the implementation. Additionally, there
is also Test Data provided that I used for testing the speed of the algorithm.
Sadly the report is written in German.

### Usage agreement
Feel free to use this implementation in any way you want. There is no licensing
applied to it and there won't be in the future. It is open source.
